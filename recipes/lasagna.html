        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is both a type of wide, flat pasta and a classic Italian baked dish made by layering 
            these pasta sheets with various fillings like ragù (meat and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, 
            vegetables, and cheeses, then baking it in an oven. The dish is assembled with layers of these 
            ingredients before being baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

            <li>8 whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 whole cloves</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>60g butter</li>
            <li>50g plain flour</li>
            <li>70g finely grated parmesan</li>
            <li>Pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for
                5 minutes or until onion softens. Add the mince and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any 
                lumps, for 5 minutes or until mince changes colour. Add the tomato, wine and tomato paste, and bring to 
                the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until sauce 
                thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, to make the cheese sauce, combine the milk, onion , parsley stalks, peppercorns, cloves and 
                bay leaves in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside 
                for 15 minutes to infuse.</li>
            <li>Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard solids.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 
                for 1-2 minutes or until mixture bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in half the milk, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk, until mixture is smooth. Gradually 
                add the remaining milk, whisking until smooth and combined.</li>
            <li>Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 
                5 minutes or until sauce thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Remove from heat. Add the parmesan and 
                stir until cheese melts. Taste and season with nutmeg, salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Brush a rectangular 3L (12 cup) capacity ovenproof dish with oil to lightly grease. 
                Spread one-quarter of the bechamel sauce over the base of the prepared dish. Arrange one of the lasagne sheets 
                over the sauce. Top with one-third of the mince mixture and one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue 
                layering with the remaining lasagne sheets, mince mixture and bechamel, finishing with a layer of bechamel. 
                Sprinkle with mozzarella. Place on a baking tray. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes or until cheese melts, 
                is golden brown, and the edges are bubbling. Remove from oven and set aside for 10 minutes to set.</li>
            <li>Cut the lasagne into 8 portions and serve with mixed salad leaves.</li>

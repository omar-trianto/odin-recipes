        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken congee is a savory rice porridge, traditionally made by simmering rice in a large amount of chicken broth or 
            stock until it breaks down into a creamy, soup-like consistency. It is a popular comfort food across many Asian 
            cultures and is often served for breakfast or as a light meal. The dish can be flavored with various seasonings and 
            topped with different garnishes like scallions, ginger, or soy sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1L chicken stock</li>
            <li>500ml water</li>
            <li>4 slices fresh young ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 cup long grain rice</li>
            <li>200g chicken tenderloin, diced into 1cm pieces</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Chinese rice wine</li>
            <li>Salt and ground white pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. finely sliced green onion</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. fried shallots</li>
            <li>2 tsp. fried garlic</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the chicken stock, water and ginger to a boil in a large heavy based saucepan over a high heat. Add the rice 
                and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer steadily for 1 hour, covered stirring occasionally to prevent the rice 
                from catching until thickened and most of the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the congee, cover and simmer for 4-5 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked. Add the rice 
                wine to the congee and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve the congee in bowls, sprinkle with the green onion, drizzle with sesame oil and top with the fried shallots 
                and garlic. Serve with soy sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
